## About

The Wall is a quiet place for thoughts. It feels like a personal scrapbook, a corkboard filled with handwritten notes, or a journal opened on a quiet desk.

## Features

- **Write notes** that look and feel like paper artifacts
- **Masonry layout** with organically placed notes
- **Paper textures** and handwritten-style typography
- **Subtle animations** - notes lift gently on hover
- **Local persistence** - your notes are saved in the browser

## Design Philosophy

Everything here is intentionally imperfect:
- Notes have random rotations and offsets
- Colors are warm, muted pastels
- No borders, no boxes, no form fields
- The experience is about writing, not submitting

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- React 19
- Vite
- CSS (no frameworks)
- Google Fonts (Caveat, Patrick Hand, Kalam)
